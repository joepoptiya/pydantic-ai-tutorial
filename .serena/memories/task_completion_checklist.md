# Task Completion Checklist

## When Task is Completed

### Code Quality
- [ ] **No linting tools configured** - manual code review required
- [ ] **No automated formatting** - ensure consistent Python style manually
- [ ] Check imports are properly organized
- [ ] Verify type hints are used where appropriate

### Testing
- [ ] **pytest available but not configured with specific test commands**
- [ ] Run `python -m pytest` if tests exist
- [ ] Test main script execution: `python src/introduction.py`
- [ ] Verify OpenAI API integration works (requires valid API key)

### Environment
- [ ] Ensure all dependencies in `requirements.txt` are satisfied
- [ ] Verify `.env` file has required API keys (OPENAI_API_KEY)
- [ ] Check Python version compatibility (3.9+ required)

### Documentation
- [ ] Update README.md if functionality changes
- [ ] Add docstrings for new functions/classes
- [ ] Document any new PydanticAI patterns or examples

### Dependencies
- [ ] Check if new dependencies need to be added to `requirements.txt`
- [ ] Verify compatibility with PydanticAI beta version constraints
- [ ] Test that virtual environment can be recreated from requirements

## Notes
- **No CI/CD configured** - manual verification required
- **PydanticAI is in beta** - API may change, test thoroughly
- **OpenAI API required** - ensure API key access for testing
